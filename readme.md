# Simple Graph lib
Support 2 types of graphs - directed and undirected with 3 operations:
* [x] addVertex - adds vertex to the graph;
* [x] addEdge - adds edge to the graph;
* [x] getPath - returns a list of edges between 2 vertices (path is not optimal).

Vertices have a user-defined type.

###### TODO:
* Add weighted edges support 
* Add traverse function that will take a user defined function and apply it on every vertex of the graph.
* Make graphs thread safe.
